# Session Summary: 2026-02-02_10-30AM

### Key Accomplishments:
- Finalized all setup and workflow processes.
- Renamed all previous session summary files to the `YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mmAMPM.md` format.
- Updated `save_memory` for `save chat` to include the `YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mmAMPM.md` format and Mountain Time (Utah time) for timestamps.
- Confirmed the robust system in place for the user to pick up where they left off across sessions (using `gemini-soc`, `TODO.md`, and `Session_Summaries`).

### Decisions Made:
- All timestamping and session logging preferences are now final.
- User is ready to begin Phase 3: Advanced Practice & Capstone Project tomorrow.

### Next Steps:
- User will log in tomorrow, use `gemini-soc`, and choose an Advanced Scenario from the `Advanced_Scenarios.md` guide to start practicing.
