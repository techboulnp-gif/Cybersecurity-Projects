# Session Summary: 2026-02-02

### Key Accomplishments:
- Completed **Phase 1: Foundation & Setup**. This included:
    - Creating Desktop Info Hub with `INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `REPLICATION_GUIDE.md`.
    - Building the core project directory structure (`cyber_soc_trainee` and subdirectories).
    - Establishing project identity with `README.md` and `TODO.md`.
    - Preparing the Python virtual environment (`venv`).
    - Initializing Git version control and creating a `.gitignore` file.
    - Verifying Python and SQLite tool installations.
    - Creating and documenting the `gemini-soc` shortcut command.
- Completed **Phase 2: Guided Learning - Google Cybersecurity Course**. This included creating portfolio guides and marking completion for:
    - Linux Fundamentals: Module 1, 2, and 3.
    - SQL Basics: Module 4.
    - Python Scripting: Module 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Began **Phase 3: Advanced Practice & Capstone Project**. This included:
    - Generating Realistic Data (`fake_auth.log`, `fake_access.log`, `fake_users.csv`) and documenting the process.
    - Developing Advanced Scenarios (3 distinct scenarios for Linux, Python, and SQL application) and documenting them.
- Established the **Session Summary system** for tracking our progress.

### Decisions Made:
- Agreed on a comprehensive project plan including a capstone project.
- Decided to use Python virtual environments (`venv`) and Git's `.gitignore` for professional project management.
- Agreed to include a main `README.md` for professional presentation of the portfolio.
- Implemented the "Session Summary" system, with the `Save_Chat` folder and the `save chat` command as the trigger.

### Next Steps:
- The user is now ready to begin working on the **Advanced Practice Scenarios** (located in `/home/kali/gemini_projects/cyber_soc_trainee/advanced_practice/Advanced_Scenarios.md`).
- User needs to choose which scenario to start with.
