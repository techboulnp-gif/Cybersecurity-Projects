# Session Summary: 2026-02-02_12-49PM

The user expressed a desire to learn the fundamental Linux commands in a more structured, step-by-step manner before proceeding with complex exercises. They requested a restructuring of the project's `TODO.md` to reflect this new, beginner-friendly learning path.

Key actions and decisions:
-   A new, more granular structure for the `TODO.md` was proposed, breaking down the Google Cybersecurity Course modules into smaller, more manageable learning objectives (e.g., "Practice: `pwd`", "Practice: `ls`", etc.).
-   The user approved the new structure.
-   The `TODO.md` file was successfully updated to reflect this new learning plan, and the first new task, "Practice: `pwd` (Print Working Directory)", was marked as "in_progress".
-   The `SOC_Project_Info/INSTRUCTIONS.md` file was reviewed and it was determined that no changes were necessary as it pertains to general project workflow, not the curriculum itself.
-   A temporary directory, `temp_cli_work`, was created to provide a safe space for practicing commands.
-   The session concluded with the user's request to save the chat summary.
