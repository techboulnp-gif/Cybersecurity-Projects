# SOC Analyst Portfolio - Cyber Security Learning Journey

Welcome to my hands-on portfolio, a comprehensive collection of projects and exercises designed to demonstrate job-ready skills for a Junior Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst role. This repository documents my learning journey through the Google Cybersecurity Course and various advanced, real-world scenarios.

## Skills Demonstrated

This portfolio showcases my proficiency in:
*   **Linux Command-Line:** Efficient navigation, file system manipulation, text processing (grep, awk, sed), and log analysis.
*   **Python Scripting:** Automation, data parsing, data manipulation, and building analytical tools.
*   **SQL (SQLite3):** Database design, querying for investigative analysis, and data management.
*   **Version Control (Git & GitHub):** Collaborative development, change tracking, and project management.
*   **Cybersecurity Concepts:** Practical application of SOC analyst methodologies, incident response simulation, and threat detection.
*   **Professional Practices:** Environment management (virtual environments), code quality, and security hygiene (`.gitignore`).

## Project Structure

This repository is organized to provide a clear overview of my learning and work:

*   `.venv/`: Python virtual environment for isolated dependencies.
*   `google_course_work/`: Exercises and solutions directly from the Google Cybersecurity Course.
*   `advanced_practice/`: Additional challenges and learning materials for continuous skill development.
*   `data_sources/`: Contains fake, simulated data (logs, user lists) used for practice scenarios.
*   `portfolio_guides/`: In-depth Markdown guides detailing problem statements, methodologies, code, and results for key projects.
*   `scripts/`: Python, SQL, and shell scripts developed during this journey.

## Featured Projects (Highlights)

*(This section will be updated with links to your most impactful portfolio guides as projects are completed, especially the Capstone Project.)*

*   **Capstone Project: Automated Log Analysis & Threat Hunting**
    *   *Description:* An end-to-end project demonstrating the integration of Linux command-line tools, Python scripting, and SQL database management to automate the analysis of security logs, identify potential threats, and generate actionable intelligence.
